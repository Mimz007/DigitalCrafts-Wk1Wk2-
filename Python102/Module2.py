        #total = sum(amys_list)
        #print(total)

#2. Largest Number
#Create a list of numbers, print the largest of the numbers.
        #amys_list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
        #print("This is the largest number:", amys_list2[-1])

#3. Smallest Number
#Create a list of numbers, print the smallest of the numbers.
        #amys_list3 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
        #print("This is the smallest number:", amys_list3[:1])

#4. Even Numbers
#Create a list of numbers, print each number in the list that is even.
        #amys_list4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
        #even_list = []
        #for i in amys_list4:
            #if i % 2 == 0:
                #even_list.append(i)
        #print(even_list)

#5. Positive Numbers
#Create a list of numbers, print each number in the list that is greater than zero.
        #amys_list5 = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
        #positive_list = []
        #for i in amys_list5:
            #if i >= 0:
                #positive_list.append(i)
        #print(positive_list)

#6. Positive Numbers II
#Create a list of numbers, 
#Create a new list which contains every number in the given list which is positive.
            #amys_list6 = [-12, -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12]
            #positive_list2 = []
            #for i in amys_list6:
                #if i >= 0:
                    #positive_list2.append(i)
            #print(positive_list2)

#7. Multiply a list
#Create a list of numbers, and a single factor (also a number), 
#create a new list consisting of each of the numbers in the first list 
#multiplied by the factor. Print this list.
            #multiply_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
            #factor_result = []
            #for i in multiply_list:
            #    factor_result.append(i*2)
            #print(factor_result)
                
#8. Reverse a String
#Given a string, print the string reversed.

            #my_string = ("Beautiful") #using the traverse method
            #print(my_string[-1::-1])

            #my_string = ("Beautiful")  #using a for loop
            #mystring_reversed = ""

            #for i in range(len(my_string)-1, -1, -1):
                #mystring_reversed = mystring_reversed + my_string[i]
            #print(mystring_reversed)

#MEDIUM EXERCISES
#1. Multiply Vectors
#Given two lists of numbers of the same length, 
# create a new list by multiplying the pairs of numbers in corresponding positions in the two lists. 

vector_list1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector_list2 = [4, 5, 6]
vector_newlist = []

for i in multiply_list:
            factor_result.append(i*2)
            print(factor_result)


#2. Matrix Addition
#Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 two dimensional list is represented 
# as an list of lists:
######Calculate the result of adding the two matrices. 
######The number in each position in the resulting matrix 
######should be the sum of the numbers in the corresponding addend matrices. 

#3. Matrix Addition II
#Use your solution in Matrix Addition, and extend it to work for a pair of matrices of any size, as long as they have the same size.

#4. De-dup
##Given a list of numbers or strings, create a new list containing the same elements as the first list, except with any duplicate values removed. Print the list.

#5. Leetspeak
#Given a paragraph of text as a String, print the paragraph in leetspeak.
#To translate a String to leetspeak, you need to replace make the following character replacements 
#(treat all input characters as uppercase):

#6. Long-long Vowels
#Given a word as a string, print the result of extending any long vowels to the length of 5.

#7. Caesar Cipher
#Given a string, print the Caesar Cipher (or ROT13) of that string. What is Caesar Cipher? 
#Learn about it here.
#Use your solution to decipher the following text: "lbh zhfg hayrnea jung lbh unir yrnearq
